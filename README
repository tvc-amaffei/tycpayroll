THIS SOFTWARE GENERATES PAYROLL PDFS FOR TYC EMPLOYEES.

INSTRICTIONS FOR GENERATING TYC PAYROLL PDFS
--------------------------------------------

0. Move the WL payroll csv file to the google drive folder and confirm that the
instructor and payrate google doc files are correct.

1. Use Mac Finder on your Mac to navigate to the tycpayroll folder

2. Double-click on the file named `tycpayroll.Rproj` to open the RStudio
project on the mac

3. Make sure the bottom right pane of R-Studio is set on the "Files" tab

4. Click on the file named tyc-instructor-payroll.qmd so that it comes up
in the upper right-hand pane.

5. Review the top of the file and make sure the following info is correct
for this months processing:
- title: "April 2024 Monthly Payroll"
- output-file: "april-2024-payroll-log"
- google_user_email: "melissajlarousso@gmail.com"
- month: "04"
- year: "2024"

6. Click on the "Render" button at the top of the file shown in upper left pane (or run the CLI runner below)

7. The PDFs will be generated in the `instructor_pdfs/` subfolder

8. A log of the processing is found as a timestamped `.log` file under `logs/` (this is the authoritative run record).

Command-line usage (recommended for non-RStudio users):

```bash
# from the repository root
Rscript run_payroll.R --month=10 --year=2025 --google_user_email=you@example.com
```

Outputs:

- `instructor_pdfs/` — per-instructor payroll PDFs and `payroll-summary-<YYYYMM>.pdf`
- `csvs/` — downloaded payroll CSVs and `payroll-summary-<YYYYMM>.csv`
- `logs/` — timestamped run logs (authoritative)

Note: The previous combined Quarto payroll log was removed. The script now
produces a lightweight CSV summary `csvs/payroll-summary-<YYYYMM>.csv` and a
PDF rendering `instructor_pdfs/payroll-summary-<YYYYMM>.pdf` of that CSV.
